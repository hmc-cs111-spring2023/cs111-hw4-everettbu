# Scala Thoughts

After this assignment, I have mixed emotions towards Scala. I found that some aspects of this assignment were very easy to do in scala and it just made sense.
On the other hand, there weres some seemingly simple tasks that just did not make sense to me and took me a while to figure out how to do. I will dive into
some of my positive/negative experences here.

### Things I liked/found helpful:
- I liked the use of natural language, it seemed well done and natural feeling to use and write. 
- Building of the previous point, I liked the ability to use different types of if statements, depending on wheter you wanted to use the extra language or 
not. This seems like a great feature because people tend to think in different ways, some prefer coding in natural language while others do not.
- Testing interface was super helpful and easy to use. When learning some languages I found it hard to get used to the testing interface but it was super 
straightforward for me to pick up in scala.


### Things I found interesting:
- The lack of return statements seemed very weird to me at first but then I started to get used to it. I can see why one might like to see the return type 
specified at beggining of the function


### Things I was not a fan of/struggled with:
- I initially struggled with the image assignment, mostly because I was overthinking it. During this struggle I realized that I don't think function can be 
overloaded. In my brief attempt to overload the functions, I has hit with a handful of errors.

Overall I don't dislike scala, I might even consider myself a fan of the language. I found the image assignment particularly insightful because of how easy it
was to change the type of input and output that the function would be handling. Also, when working on mastermind, I gained an understanding of how to write in 
the language and it seemed to click, I didn't find the syntax too confusing.

Moving forward, I would like to further learn about how data structures opperate in Scala. In addition to that, I want to know who uses Scala and why it was 
created. What specific purpose does it serve?
